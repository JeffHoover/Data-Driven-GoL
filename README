I started this as a data-driven example of Conway's Game of Life
at the Global Day of Code Retreat in Ann Arbor, Michigan

Patrick Welsh gave me some ideas to make it more readable, including
a reduction in the duplication of the table data and the LiveNeighbors
enum instead of magic numbers.


I have provided two styles of tests. Each style fully covers the behavior
of GoL. The names of the first kind all start with "Rule_" and correspond 
to rules 1-4 as listed in Wikipedia.

The other set of tests all have names starting with "Alive" or "Dead". They
correspond to the grid that Patrick suggested:

Num Alive Neighbors          : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Cell Initially Alive Becomes : D D A A D D D D D D
Cell Initially Dead Becomes  : D D D A D D D D D D
Which shows that there are only 3 cases of 18 in which a cell becomes or stays
alive.

I'm still not happy with how the Asserts read. I'll have to figure out
how to improve them. But the test names, data tables, and test results
are pretty easy to read.
